# Quantum-scheme-optimisation-

To run the experiments, first install the required packages:
```bash
pip3 install (list of required packages)
```

Then, run the following command to start the experiments:
```bash
./run_test.sh
```

This will execute the `run_test.sh` script, which is responsible for running the experiments. The script will automatically run the script across all defined quantum computers and save the results in the `results` directory.
